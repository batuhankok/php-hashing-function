# PHP Password or String Hashing Function
This script encodes and decodes your texts, strings or passwords safely. Also, it can be **decode** your encoded text because it is symmetrical. If you have questions, you can contact me by using my blog or twitter.


##### You can develope yourself in these topics:
- Working with function.
- Working with arrays.
- Working with strings. // ` wordwrap(); ` ` strtr(); `
- Working with ` base64_encode(); ` and ` base64_decode(); `.

It requires **PHP 4.0** and above.
