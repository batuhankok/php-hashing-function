# PHP Password Hashing Function (encoding-decoding)(symmetrical)
This script encodes and decodes your text safely. Also, it can be **decode** your encoded text. It is completly free because my main reason is to provide everyone's benefit. If you have questions, you can contact me by using my blog or twitter.

##### You can develope yourself in these topics:
- Working with function.
- Working with arrays.
- Working with strings. // ` wordwrap(); ` ` strtr(); `
- Working with ` base64_encode(); ` and ` base64_decode(); `.

It requires **PHP 4.0** and above.
